# PurePursuitController3D — Regulated Pure Pursuit for 3D AUVs

A Nav2 controller plugin (`orca_nav2/PurePursuitController3D`) that adapts
[Regulated Pure Pursuit (RPP)](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_regulated_pure_pursuit_controller)
to a 3D under-water vehicle. Source: [pure_pursuit_controller_3d.cpp](src/pure_pursuit_controller_3d.cpp).

The controller produces a 3-DoF differential-drive command (`linear.x`,
`linear.z`, `angular.z`) — `linear.y` is intentionally never commanded because
lateral drag on the BlueROV2 hull is much higher than longitudinal drag.

> **TL;DR** — XY tracking uses Regulated Pure Pursuit with hysteresis,
> rotate-to-heading, curvature-regulated speed, approach slow-down, and a
> velocity-divergence emergency cutoff. Depth (`linear.z`) is controlled
> independently with a sqrt-deceleration profile.

The control loop is split into three independent axes that are then merged:

| Axis | Source | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `linear.z` | depth error to lookahead pose | `z_vel` with sqrt deceleration on remaining depth |
| `linear.x` | regulated pure pursuit | scaled down by curvature + approach distance |
| `angular.z` | curvature carrot or rotate-to-heading | `v · κ`, replaced by rotate-in-place when heading error large |

## Features

### 1. Two independent lookahead points

A signature change from vanilla pure pursuit. Two carrots are picked from the
plan on every tick:

- **Main carrot** (`lookahead_dist`, optionally velocity-scaled) — drives the
  forward velocity decision and the goal-proximity check.
- **Curvature carrot** (`curvature_lookahead_dist`, fixed) — drives the
  curvature κ used for `angular.z = v · κ` and the rotate-to-path trigger.

**Why two?** With a single velocity-scaled lookahead, a slow speed produces a
short lookahead, which produces a high curvature, which forces the regulator
to slow down further — a feedback loop that can stall the vehicle. The fixed
curvature lookahead breaks this loop. Toggle with `use_fixed_curvature_lookahead`.

### 2. Rotate-to-heading with hysteresis

When the heading error to the curvature carrot exceeds
`rotate_to_heading_min_angle`, the controller stops translating (`linear.x = 0`)
and rotates in place using a **sqrt deceleration profile**:

```
ω_cmd = sign(Δθ) · min( rotate_to_heading_angular_vel ,
                        sqrt(2 · rotate_to_heading_decel · |Δθ|) )
```

Two important design points:

- **Hysteresis** — entry threshold `rotate_to_heading_min_angle`, exit
  threshold `rotate_to_heading_release_angle` (smaller). Without this,
  the controller releases rotation as soon as the error dips below the entry
  threshold, then drifts cross-track on the residual error. The release
  threshold must satisfy `release_angle < v² / (2 · decel)` so the rotation
  finishes inside the deceleration window. See
  [pure_pursuit_controller_3d.cpp:360-375](src/pure_pursuit_controller_3d.cpp#L360-L375).
- **Separate braking parameter** — `rotate_to_heading_decel` is the *real*
  AUV angular braking capability (rad/s²), distinct from `yaw_accel` (the
  command ramp rate). Water drag means the actual braking is much weaker
  than the ramp rate. Lower values = brake earlier = less overshoot.

### 3. Rotate-to-path → tracking handoff

When releasing rotate-to-path, the previous tick's `angular.z` is still in
`prev_vel_`. With small `yaw_accel · dt` the limiter would carry that residual
into the tracking phase and cause overshoot/sway. The controller zeroes
`prev_vel_.angular.z` and `prev_vel_.linear.x` exactly on the rotate→track
edge so the curvature-driven yaw rate ramps from 0. See
[pure_pursuit_controller_3d.cpp:533-536](src/pure_pursuit_controller_3d.cpp#L533-L536).

### 4. Stateful goal-heading alignment

Once the AUV enters `goal_tolerance` in XY, `has_reached_xy_tolerance_`
latches to `true`. From then on, the controller stays in "rotate to final
plan orientation" mode even if currents push it slightly back out of
tolerance. Disable by setting `stateful: false`.

### 5. Curvature-regulated linear velocity

When `use_regulated_linear_vel_scaling: true`, forward speed is scaled down
proportionally as the turning radius shrinks below
`regulated_linear_scaling_min_radius`:

```
v_scaled = v · min(1, R / R_min)
v       = max(v_scaled, regulated_linear_scaling_min_speed)
```

The floor (`min_speed`) prevents the AUV from creeping to a halt mid-turn.

### 6. Approach velocity scaling

In the last `approach_velocity_scaling_dist` metres of the plan, `linear.x`
is linearly scaled by `path_remaining / approach_velocity_scaling_dist`,
floored at `min_approach_linear_velocity`. This is **independent** of the
sqrt deceleration applied by the `Limiter`; both are stacked.

### 7. Optional velocity-scaled lookahead

When `use_velocity_scaled_lookahead: true`, the **main** carrot is recomputed
as `clamp(|speed| · lookahead_time, [min_lookahead_dist, max_lookahead_dist])`.
The **curvature** carrot is unaffected — it is always either the static
`lookahead_dist` or `curvature_lookahead_dist`.

### 8. Cross-track velocity damping (optional PD term)

When `K_cross_vel > 0`, a derivative term is added to `angular.z` based on the
component of measured velocity perpendicular to the path tangent:

```
v_cross   = vel.x·sin(yaw_err) + vel.y·cos(yaw_err)
angular.z -= K_cross_vel · v_cross
```

This penalises lateral drift directly rather than waiting for cross-track
displacement to develop. Disabled by default (`K_cross_vel: 0.0`).

### 9. Velocity-divergence emergency cutoff

A safety net that watches the angle between the velocity vector and the path
tangent. If the AUV is moving faster than `min_speed_divergence_check` and the
divergence exceeds `max_velocity_divergence_rad`, the controller will:

1. Publish `False` on `/pixhawk/arm_cmd` → disarm.
2. Publish `MANUAL` on `/pixhawk/mode_cmd` → manual mode.
3. Throw `std::runtime_error` → aborts the Nav2 action.

Disable with `max_velocity_divergence_rad: 0.0`. The mechanism is symmetric:
it fires both when the AUV moves *into* the path and *away* from it. See
[pure_pursuit_controller_3d.cpp:748-776](src/pure_pursuit_controller_3d.cpp#L748-L776).

### 10. Acceleration limiting per-axis

Three `Limiter` instances (one each for `linear.x`, `linear.z`, `angular.z`)
clamp the per-tick step in velocity to `max_a · dt`. Each limiter also offers
a sqrt deceleration profile used for the depth axis and inside
`rotateToHeading`.

Note: nav2's controller server delivers a 2D twist, so `linear.z` history is
maintained on our own copy of `prev_vel_` rather than the velocity passed in.

### 11. Tracking-error telemetry

When `publish_tracking_error: true` (the default), the controller publishes
six topics every tick:

| Topic | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pure_pursuit_cross_track_xy` | `std_msgs/Float64` | signed XY cross-track error (m), + = left of path |
| `pure_pursuit_vertical_error` | `std_msgs/Float64` | depth error vs. closest point (m) |
| `pure_pursuit_yaw_error` | `std_msgs/Float64` | shortest yaw error vs. path tangent (rad) |
| `pure_pursuit_closest_point_map` | `geometry_msgs/PointStamped` | closest point on plan polyline (map frame) |
| `pure_pursuit_robot_pose_map` | `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped` | robot pose transformed into the plan frame |
| `pure_pursuit_robot_twist` | `geometry_msgs/TwistStamped` | the twist passed in by the controller server |

The closest point is computed as a true polyline projection (per-segment
clamped parameter `t ∈ [0,1]`), not as the closest discrete plan pose.

### 12. Independent depth control

`linear.z` is computed independently of the XY tracking logic. It uses
`z_vel` with the `Limiter`'s sqrt-decel profile against the remaining depth
to the main carrot, and is gated by `goal_tolerance`. Because buoyancy and
drag dominate vertical motion, no curvature/approach regulation is needed.

## Lifecycle / outputs

- Subscribes (via Nav2): pose, twist, plan.
- Publishes:
  - `/pixhawk/arm_cmd` (`std_msgs/Bool`) — only on emergency disarm.
  - `/pixhawk/mode_cmd` (`std_msgs/String`) — only on emergency mode change.
  - The six `pure_pursuit_*` telemetry topics listed above.
- Throws `std::runtime_error` on velocity-divergence emergency.
- Throws `nav2_core::PlannerException` if `setPlan()` is called with an empty path.
- `setSpeedLimit()` is **not** supported (logs an error if invoked).

---

## Known limitations

- Costmaps are ignored — this controller is for open water, not obstacle avoidance.
- `linear.y` is never commanded (intentional — see hull drag note above).
- The Nav2 velocity smoother is bypassed (it is not 3D-aware).
- `yaw_vel` is read from params but the rotate-to-heading path uses its own
  `rotate_to_heading_angular_vel`. Make sure both are set if you tune one.
